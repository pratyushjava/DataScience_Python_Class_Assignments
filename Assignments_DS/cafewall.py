# Programming Assignment #2, Part B


# This program intends to draw several instances of the CafeÃÅ Wall illusion.
# In this optical illusion
# The rows appear not to be straight even though they are.
# This image has several levels of structure.
# Black and white squares are used to form rows and rows are combined to form grids.

# This fuction includes all the parameters which are required to be passed.
# This fuction also includes the drawing panel.
# This fuction calls all the sub fuctions.
# Yo thats it bro! rest read down

# Nice to see that. If you are still intresed roll your eyes down coz
# Best is yet to come man!
